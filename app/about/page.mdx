# About Renou Homes

We started Renou Homes because we saw families struggling with one of life's most overwhelming transitions: letting go of a lifetime of possessions.

## Our Story

Whether it's downsizing after retirement, navigating a divorce, or settling an estate, the process of cataloging, valuing, and distributing a household is emotionally draining and logistically complex.

We realized that what families needed wasn't just an estate sale company or a junk removal service. They needed a comprehensive partner who could:

- Treat their possessions with respect
- Preserve family stories and provenance  
- Navigate family dynamics with sensitivity
- Use modern technology to bring transparency
- Handle every detail from start to finish

That's what we built.

## Our Approach

<div className="bg-renou-cream p-6 rounded-lg my-8">

### Technology + Humanity

We use cutting-edge inventory software, AI-assisted valuations, and digital marketplaces. But we never forget that every item has a story and every transition is deeply personal.

</div>

### Transparency

You have real-time access to your inventory, sales progress, and financial tracking. No surprises. No hidden fees.

### Family First

Before any item goes to market, family members have the opportunity to claim heirlooms. We facilitate communication and help prevent conflicts.

### Professional Network

We've built relationships with the best appraisers, estate attorneys, moving companies, and senior living advisors. One call gets you access to trusted professionals.

## Our Values

**Dignity** - We honor the lives represented in every home we work with.

**Integrity** - We provide honest valuations and transparent accounting.

**Efficiency** - We respect your time and move projects forward quickly.

**Compassion** - We understand these transitions are emotional, not just transactional.

## Who We Serve

- **Retirees downsizing** to smaller homes or senior living communities
- **Families navigating divorce** who need to divide household assets
