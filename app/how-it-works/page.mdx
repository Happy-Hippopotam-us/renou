# How It Works

Our process is designed to be simple, transparent, and respectful of your time and emotions.

## Step 1: Free Consultation

**Duration: 30-60 minutes**

We start with a conversation to understand your situation:

- What type of transition are you facing?
- What are your goals and timeline?
- Which items need special attention?
- Who needs to be involved in decisions?

This consultation can happen at your home, over video call, or by phone.

  **No obligation. No pressure. Just honest advice about what help you need.**
</div>

## Step 2: Custom Proposal

Within 48 hours, we provide:

- Detailed scope of work
- Timeline estimate
- Transparent pricing
- Service agreement

You decide what makes sense. We're happy to do as much or as little as you need.

## Step 3: On-Site Inventory

**Timeline: 1-3 days depending on home size**

Our team arrives with professional equipment:

- Room-by-room photography
- Digital cataloging on tablets
- Voice notes for provenance stories
- Initial categorization (keep, sell, donate, dispose)

We work respectfully and can accommodate family members who want to participate.

## Step 4: Valuation & Planning

**Timeline: 1-2 weeks**

We coordinate with appraisers as needed and organize items into:

- **Family distribution** - Items for specific heirs
- **High-value sales** - Pieces worth specialized marketing
- **Online marketplace** - Standard household items
- **Donation** - Items for charitable giving
- **Disposal** - Items with no resale value

You review and approve all categorizations.

## Step 5: Execution

We handle the logistics:

- Schedule repairs or cleanings
- List items on appropriate platforms
- Manage inquiries and negotiations
- Coordinate pickups and deliveries
- Track sales and maintain records

You stay informed through our client portal with real-time updates.

## Step 6: Final Settlement

Once complete, you receive:

- Complete financial accounting
- Digital archive of all items
- Documentation for tax purposes
- Distribution records for heirs
